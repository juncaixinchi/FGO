# Aister's FGO + Canvas project
Several projects that experiment on HTML5 canvas

## Card generator

An expansion of juncaixinchi's original concept of using canvas to generate FGO cards. The generator itself can be found [here](https://aister.github.io/FGO/fgo.html)

Original code can be found [here](https://github.com/juncaixinchi/FGO)

## Gacha Simulator

Using canvas to generate gacha. Could have used simple img tbh
